# GraphNetWorkCommunicate Knowledge System

## üìö **Knowledge Curation Directory**

- All content in this directory is "knowledge curation".
- **Objective**: Systematically organize and present interdisciplinary knowledge across graph theory, network topology, communication protocols, distributed systems, quantum communication, biological networks, social networks, and formal verification.
- **Requirements**:
  - Concept definitions, properties, theorems and proofs, models and semantics, methodologies, comparative analysis, encyclopedia entries/glossaries.
  - Align with international expression and academic standards, provide bilingual terminology and formal expressions.
  - Exclude engineering implementation, running scripts, dependency installation, and other "programming technology" content.
