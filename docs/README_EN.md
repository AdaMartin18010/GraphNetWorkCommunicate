# GraphNetWorkCommunicate Knowledge System

## 📚 **Knowledge Curation Directory**

- All content in this directory is "knowledge curation".
- **Objective**: Systematically organize and present interdisciplinary knowledge across graph theory, network topology, communication protocols, distributed systems, quantum communication, biological networks, social networks, and formal verification.
- **Requirements**:
  - Concept definitions, properties, theorems and proofs, models and semantics, methodologies, comparative analysis, encyclopedia entries/glossaries.
  - Align with international expression and academic standards, provide bilingual terminology and formal expressions.
  - Exclude engineering implementation, running scripts, dependency installation, and other "programming technology" content.

## 🧭 **Navigation**

**Note**: For engineering implementation, visualization scripts, or dependency instructions, please refer to the "Project Positioning and Navigation" section in the repository root README or independent engineering repositories (if applicable).

## 🌐 **Bilingual Support**

This knowledge system provides comprehensive bilingual support (Chinese-English) for all content:

- **Concept Definitions**: All core concepts have both Chinese and English definitions
- **Theorem Statements**: All theorems are presented in both languages
- **Proof Explanations**: Detailed proof explanations in both languages
- **Explanations and Examples**: Expository texts and examples include bilingual annotations
- **Visualization Labels**: All diagrams and charts have bilingual labels

## 📖 **Reading Guide**

### For Beginners
