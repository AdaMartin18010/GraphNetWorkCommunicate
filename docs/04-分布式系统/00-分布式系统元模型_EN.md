## 1.1 Objects and Structures

- **Objects**: Distributed system $S=\langle N, P, Q, M, E, \leq, \mathcal{S} \rangle$, where $N$ is the node set, $P$ is the process set, $Q$ is the message queue set, $M$ is the message set, $E$ is the event set, $\leq$ is the partial order relation, $\mathcal{S}$ is the global state set
- **Structures**: Nodes, processes, messages, events, global states, event ordering, causal relationships

## 1.2 Basic Relations

- $R_{comm}$: Communication relation
- $R_{sync}$: Synchronization/asynchronization relation
- $R_{cons}$: Consistency/consensus relation

## 1.3 Important Theorems and Reasoning

- **Theorem 1.3.1** (CAP Theorem): A distributed system cannot simultaneously guarantee Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance
- **Theorem 1.3.2** (FLP Impossibility Theorem): In an asynchronous system, it is impossible to achieve consensus in the presence of even one faulty process
- **Theorem 1.3.3** (Total Order Broadcast Equivalence): Total order broadcast is equivalent to consensus

## 1.4 Reasoning and Proof System

- Event ordering reasoning, causality reasoning, consensus algorithm reasoning, unreachability proofs
- Multi-modal representation: timing diagrams, causal graphs, state transition diagrams, message sequence charts

## 1.5 Mapping to Meta-Model

- Distributed system $S$ is an instance of Meta-model object $S$
- Communication, synchronization, consensus are concrete realizations of $R_{comm},R_{sync},R_{cons}$

## 1.6 Summary
