# Graph Theory Meta-Model

## 1.1 Objects and Structures

- **Objects**: Graph $G=(V,E)$, directed graph, undirected graph, multigraph, weighted graph, etc.
- **Structures**: Vertex set $V$, edge set $E$, adjacency relations, degree, path, cycle, components, etc.

## 1.2 Basic Relations

- $R_{adj}$: Adjacency relation
- $R_{path}$: Path relation
- $R_{iso}$: Isomorphism relation
- $R_{sub}$: Subgraph relation

## 1.3 Important Theorems and Reasoning

- **Theorem 1.3.1** (Euler's Theorem): A connected undirected graph has an Euler circuit if and only if all vertices have even degree.
- **Theorem 1.3.2** (Graph Isomorphism): $G_1\cong G_2$ exists if and only if there exists a bijection $f:V_1\to V_2$ that preserves adjacency relations.
- **Theorem 1.3.3** (Graph Decomposition): Any graph can be decomposed into several connected components.

## 1.4 Reasoning and Proof System

- Adopts rigorous mathematical proofs using induction, contradiction, construction, etc.
- Multi-modal representation: formal symbols, diagrams, tables

## 1.5 Mapping to Meta-Model

- Graph $G$ is a concrete instance of Meta-model object $G$
- Adjacency, path, isomorphism, etc. are concrete realizations of Meta-model relations $R_{conn},R_{map}$

## 1.6 Summary

This chapter establishes the meta-model for the graph theory branch, providing foundational structure and reasoning tools for subsequent topology, protocol, system, and other branches.

## Multi-Modal Expression and Visualization

- **Structure Diagrams**: Use Graphviz/NetworkX to automatically generate undirected graphs, directed graphs, weighted graphs, and other structural illustrations.
- **Flow Charts**: Use Mermaid/PlantUML to describe shortest path, maximum flow, and other algorithm flows.
- **Heat Maps/Adjacency Matrices**: Use Matplotlib to display node attributes and connectivity.
- **Automation Script Suggestions**:
  - `scripts/graph_visualization.py`: Input adjacency list/matrix, output structure diagrams and heat maps.
- **Examples**:
  - Graphviz DOT code snippet:

    ```dot
    digraph G {
      A -> B;
      B -> C;
      C -> A;
    }
    ```

  - Mermaid flow chart:

    ```mermaid
    graph TD;
      A-->B;
      B-->C;
      C-->A;
    ```

## 1.7 Formal Semantics and Concept Explanation (Recursive Completion)

### 1.7.1 Formal Semantics

- **Set Theory Semantics**:
  - Graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the vertex set and $E\subseteq V\times V$ is the edge set.
  - Subgraph, complement graph, isomorphism, connected components, etc. all have precise set-theoretic definitions.
- **Category Theory Semantics**:
  - Objects are graphs, morphisms are structure-preserving mappings (homomorphisms, isomorphisms, embeddings, etc.), functors describe structural mappings between different graph classes.
  - Graph properties (such as connectivity, Eulerian property) can be expressed using commutative diagrams.
- **Automaton Semantics**:
  - Graph traversal, path search, etc. can be modeled as automaton state transitions on graphs.

### 1.7.2 Formal Concept Explanation

- **Connectivity**:
  - There exists a path between any two vertices.
  - Formal: $\forall u,v\in V,\ \exists$ path $P$ such that $u\to v$.
- **Euler Circuit**:
  - A circuit that traverses each edge exactly once.
  - Formal: $\exists$ circuit $C$, $\forall e\in E,\ e\in C$ and each $e$ appears only once in $C$.
- **Graph Isomorphism**:
  - There exists a bijection $f:V_1\to V_2$ such that $(u,v)\in E_1\iff (f(u),f(v))\in E_2$.

### 1.7.3 Typical Theorems and Proofs (Multi-Modal Expression)

- **Connectivity Theorem**:
  - Proposition: A connected undirected graph has a spanning tree.
  - Proof: Use BFS/DFS to traverse all vertices, the edges traversed form a spanning tree.
- **Menger's Theorem (Formal Proof)**:
  - Proposition: The minimum cut between two points equals the maximum number of vertex-disjoint paths.
  - Proof: Induction + construction method, see main document for details.
- **Euler Circuit Criterion Theorem**:
  - Proposition: A connected undirected graph with all vertices of even degree has an Euler circuit.
  - Proof: Induction method, see Euler's theorem for details.

### 1.7.4 Multi-Modal Expression and Automation Scripts

- **Structure Diagrams**: Graphviz/NetworkX to draw typical graph structures.
- **Flow Charts**: Mermaid to describe BFS/DFS, Euler circuit, and other algorithm flows.
- **Automation Script Suggestions**:
  - `scripts/graph_formal_semantics.py`: Input graph structure, output connectivity, Eulerian property, isomorphism detection, and automated proof.
